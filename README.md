## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing Air France's online advertising campaigns across Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and Kayak platforms. Using predictive modeling techniques and insightful analysis, the objective was to enhance ad performance, reduce costs, and maximize ROI.

The analysis included:
- Cleaning and exploring advertising data for trends and outliers.
- Developing and tuning multiple regression models to predict key campaign metrics.
- Identifying actionable recommendations for budget allocation and campaign adjustments.

This project demonstrates expertise in data-driven marketing, advanced modeling, and actionable business insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, model training, and validation.
- **R**: Advanced statistical analysis and insights generation.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and feature engineering.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Regression modeling and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization.

## Repository Structure
- `Code/`: 
  - Contains the Jupyter Notebook (`ASSIGNMENT_TEAM_9.ipynb`) with Python modeling and analysis.
  - R Markdown file (`Team9_Analysis in R-2.Rmd`) and its corresponding HTML output.
- `Data/`: 
  - `sample_submission.csv`: Initial data sample.
  - `ORIGINAL_VALUES.csv`: Cleaned dataset used for analysis.
  - `FINAL_SUBMISSION_ELASTIC_MODEL.csv`: Final predictions submitted to Kaggle.
- `Documents/`:
  - `Team9_Analysis in R-1.html`: Insightful report with visualizations and recommendations.
  - `BUSINESS_CHALLENGE_III.pdf`: Complete project report summarizing findings.

## Key Insights
- **Budget Allocation**: Google and Kayak campaigns showed the highest ROI, suggesting budget reallocation for better performance.
- **Cost Efficiency**: The ElasticNet regression model identified key factors affecting CPA (Cost Per Acquisition), enabling cost-effective campaign planning.
- **Ad Strategy Optimization**: Results demonstrated that focusing on high-CTR campaigns significantly impacts revenue while reducing costs.

These insights provide actionable recommendations for maximizing returns from sponsored search campaigns.
